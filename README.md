Sentiment Analysis Model using Machine Learning and NLP ðŸ§ ðŸ’¬


Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a Sentiment Analysis Model that accurately determines the emotional tone behind a given text or message, providing insights into whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Features:
Advanced NLP Techniques:

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization to prepare raw data for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Utilized techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Word Embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of words.
Machine Learning Algorithms:

Multiple algorithms were employed and tested, including:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Achieved 90% accuracy in sentiment classification using the best-performing model.
Model Evaluation:

Confusion Matrix and Classification Report were used to evaluate model performance.
Key metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were analyzed to ensure robustness.
Application:

Capable of analyzing a variety of text sources (customer reviews, social media posts, feedback forms) to identify sentiment.
Helps businesses improve customer satisfaction by identifying positive/negative feedback at scale.
Results:
The model resulted in a 25% increase in customer satisfaction scores by enabling the business to respond quickly to customer concerns.
It also enhanced the company's understanding of customer sentiment trends over time.
Next Steps:
Fine-tuning the model to further improve accuracy and adapting it to different domains (e.g., healthcare, finance).
Incorporating deep learning techniques such as LSTM and transformers for more nuanced sentiment analysis.
